Explore the Dataset

Project Introduction:

Objective: This Python project aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset provided by ABC company, containing detailed information 
about its employees. The key objectives included:

    1.Data Preprocessing:

Imported essential modules: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Handled missing or incorrect data effectively.
Rectified the 'height' column by replacing incorrect values with random numbers within the range of 150 to 180.
    2.Team Analysis:

Calculated the employee count in each team and the percentage distribution concerning the total workforce.
Visualized the team distribution using a countplot for clear representation.
    3.Position Segregation:

Segmented employees based on their positions to analyze the distribution among various roles within the company.
Visualized the position distribution using countplot visualization.
    4.Age Group Identification:

Identified the predominant age group among employees.
Visualized the age distribution using countplots for enhanced insight.
    5.Salary Analysis:

Determined the team and position with the highest salary spending.
Utilized scatterplots to illustrate the relationship between team, position, and salary expenditures.
    6.Correlation between Age and Salary:

Explored the relationship between employees' age and their corresponding salaries.
Presented discovered correlations through heatmaps for clear visualization.
Conclusion: The analysis provided valuable insights into various aspects including team distributions, salary expenditures across different positions, demographics concerning employee age, and correlations between age and salary within the ABC company. These findings significantly contribute to understanding the internal dynamics and resource allocation of the organization
